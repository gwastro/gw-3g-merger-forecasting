## Abstract ##
We present the prospects for the pre-merger detection and localization of binary neutron star mergers with third generation gravitational-wave observatories. We consider a wide variety of gravitational-wave networks which may be operating in the 2030's and beyond; these networks include up to two Cosmic Explorer sites, the Einstein Telescope, and continued observation with the existing second generation ground-based detectors. For a fiducial merger rate of 300 Gpc^-3 yr^-1, we find that the Einstein Telescope on its own is able to detect 6 (2) sources per year 5 (30) minutes before merger and provide a localization of <10 deg^2. A single Cosmic Explorer would detect but be unable to localize sources on its own. A two-detector Cosmic Explorer network, however, would detect 22 (0.4) mergers per year using the same criteria. A full three-detector network with the operation of dual Cosmic Explorers and the Einstein Telescope would allow for <1 deg^2 source localization at 5 minutes before merger for ~7 sources per year. Given the dramatic increase in localization and detection capabilities, third generation observatories will enable the regular observation of the prompt emission of mergers by a broad array of observatories including gamma-ray, x-ray, and optical telescopes. Moreover, sub-degree localizations minutes before merger, combined with narrow-field-of-view high-energy telescopes, could strongly constrain the high-energy pre-merger emission models proposed in the last decade.

## Data Release ##

This respository contains summary data needed to recreate the figures from the paper. We are also happy
to make available the low level data products, including  sky localizations for each simulated signal.
Due to github default file/repo size constraints, this data is not included in this repository at this time.
